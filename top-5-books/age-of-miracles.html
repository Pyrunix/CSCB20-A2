        <p>
          “It’s never the disasters you see coming that finally come to pass—it’s the ones you don’t expect at all,”
          says Julia, in this spellbinding novel of catastrophe and survival by a superb new writer. Luminous,
          suspenseful, unforgettable, The Age of Miracles tells the haunting and beautiful story of Julia and her family
          as they struggle to live in a time of extraordinary change.
          <br>

          On an ordinary Saturday in a California suburb, Julia awakens to discover that something has happened to the
          rotation of the earth. The days and nights are growing longer and longer; gravity is affected; the birds, the
          tides, human behavior, and cosmic rhythms are thrown into disarray. In a world that seems filled with danger
          and loss, Julia also must face surprising developments in herself, and in her personal world: divisions
          widening between her parents; strange behavior by her friends; the pain and vulnerability of first love; a
          growing sense of isolation; and a surprising, rebellious new strength. With crystalline prose and the
          indelible magic of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson Walker paints a breathtaking portrait of people finding
          ways to go on in an ever-evolving world.
