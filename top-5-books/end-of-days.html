        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>Another riveting page-turner from Canada's favourite teen author--and this time, the adventure takes place in
          outer space.

          It's 2012 and the world's most renowned astrophysicists, astronomers, and theoretical mathematicians have all
          died within the same 12-month period. But as these scientists discover, none of them are really dead after
          all. They have been taken hostage by alien forces. And while their family and friends are mourning their
          passing, and with the help of a 16-year-old with rare gifts, they face the ultimate struggle of prevailing
          over evil and returning themselves--and the earth--to safety.
